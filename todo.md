# TODO

1. World Size with Display Tiling
2. Physics with position rolling
    1.  simple velocity settings x + y with rollover
    2.  simple velocity from forces 
3. Gravity
    1. point source
    2. multiple point sources
    3. gravity to surface.
4. Collision
    1. Collision Polygon (with mouse et puis avec les autres)
        1. define and optionally display
        2. collision spherical
        3. collision polygon with acute angles only
        4. collision polygon conversion to triangles! (non convex hit boxes)
        5. collision with arcs
        6. Quad trees
    2. Non entangled collisions
    3. Entangled collisions(with spring?)
5. Player Controls
    1. Ship 
        engine + thrusters (stop points) + rotation thrusters (stop) 
    2. Move Screen with player (exact or following (velocity))
    3. Rotate screen with player when on the surface of a planet (rotational velocity, not snap)
6. Planets
    1. Gravity
    2. Surface Friction 
    3. Atmospheric drag
    4. Rotate player with planet ?
